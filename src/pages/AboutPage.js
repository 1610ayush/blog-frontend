            <p>
                Welcome to my blog! My name is Ayush. I am passionate Backend Developer with a flair for automation and web development. As a Growth Engineer Intern at Workduck, I've been fortunate to work on a wide array of projects and cutting-edge technologies that have honed my skills and ignited my love for creating efficient and seamless user experiences.

            During my time at Workduck, I played a pivotal role in enhancing lead and agent tracking by automating Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. This endeavor not only boosted data accuracy but also empowered our team to focus on strategic decision-making, resulting in improved outcomes. Additionally, I delved into prompt engineering, creating LLM flows on Flowise, and hosting them on EC2 instances, optimizing processes and elevating user interactions to new heights.
            A key area of my expertise lies in data streaming from LLM flows, enabling real-time insights that drive informed business decisions. My contributions extended beyond engineering, as I enriched our Framer website by incorporating intuitive search functionalities and adding captivating animations, fostering an enhanced user interface that captivated and engaged visitors.
